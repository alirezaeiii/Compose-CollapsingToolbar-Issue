## Features
* Modular Android App Architecture.
* MVVM Architecture + Repository design Pattern.
* Jetpack Libraries and Architecture Components.
* Kotlin Gradle DSL.

## Modules

Modules are collection of source files and build settings that allow you to divide a project into discrete units of functionality. In this case apart from dividing by functionality/responsibility, existing the following dependence between them. The project is divided into 4 Modules :

#### App module

The `:app` module is an [com.android.application](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/), which is needed to create the app bundle.

#### Core module

The `:core` module is an [com.android.library](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library) for serving network requests. Providing the data source for the many features that require it.

#### Common module

The `:common` module is an [com.android.library](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library) only contains code and resources which are shared between feature modules. Reusing this way resources, layouts, views, and components in the different features modules, without the need to duplicate code.

#### Feature module

The `:feature_list` module is an [com.android.library](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library) which is a module containing a specific feature, isolated from the rest in accordance with business logic.

## Testing
Local unit testing is done for ViewModel layer in `:feature_list` module.

## Libraries
* [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)
   * [Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) Android’s modern toolkit for building native UI.
   * [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) ViewModel is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. This allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
   * [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) is a library for data storage persistence which provides an abstraction layer over SQLite.
   * [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/) Android Jetpack's Navigation component helps you implement effective navigation.
   * [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project.
* [Coil-compose](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/compose/) An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines.
* [Kotlin coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) Executing code asynchronously.
* [StateFlow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow/stateflow-and-sharedflow) is a state-holder observable flow that emits the current and new state updates to its collectors.
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) is a Type-safe HTTP client for Android, Java and Kotlin by Square.
* [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) is a modern JSON library for Android and Java. It makes it easy to parse JSON format data.
* [OkHttp interceptor](https://github.com/square/okhttp/tree/master/okhttp-logging-interceptor) Logs HTTP requests and responses.
* [Mockito](https://github.com/mockito/mockito) which is the most popular Mocking framework for unit tests written in Java as well as Kotlin.
